# netlify-plugin-inline-source

A Netlify Build plugin to inline your assets/sources, built on top of the [`inline-source` package](https://github.com/popeindustries/inline-source). By default, It inlines and compresses tags that use the `inline` attribute and supports `<script>`, `<link>`, and `<img>` (including `svg`).

Inlining your assets/sources can lead to faster websites as it reduces the number of HTTP requests, at the cost of making your HTML files heavier. For best performance, you should only inline critical content and let the rest load normally.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- inline `styles.css` to a `<style>` tag -->
    <link inline href="styles.css" />

    <!-- inline `main.js` to a `<script>` tag -->
    <script inline src="main.js"></script>

    <!-- inline a remote file to a `<script>` tag -->
    <script inline src="https://some-website.com/script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- inline `image.png` to a `<img src="data:image/png;base64, â€¦">` tag -->
    <img inline src="image.png" />

    <!-- inline `image.svg` to a `<svg>` tag -->
    <img inline src="image.svg" />
  </body>
</html>
```

## Usage and inputs

To install the plugin, add it to your `netlify.toml` file.

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-inline-source"

  # All inputs are optional, so you can omit this section.
  # Defaults are shown below.
  # You can also refer to the `inline-source` documentation: https://github.com/popeindustries/inline-source#usage.
  [plugins.inputs]
    # Attribute used to parse sources. All tags will be parsed if set to `false`.
    attribute = "inline"

    # Enable/disable compression of inlined content.
    compress = true

    # Maintain leading whitespace when `compress` is `false`.
    pretty = false

    # Disable inlining based on tag, type, and/or format.
    ignore = []

    # Convert `<img inline src="*.svg" />` to `<img>` and not `<svg>`.
    svgAsImage = false
```

Once installed and configured, the plugin will automatically run on the Netlify CI.
