## About

The **Township Small Business Chatbot Algorithm** is a full-stack web application designed to empower township businesses by connecting them with customers in their local community. The platform allows businesses to register, list their products and services, and be discovered by customers. Customers can search for businesses, request services, and use geo-location tracking for seamless delivery.

This platform is driven by an AI chatbot, which helps customers find businesses quickly, make inquiries, and order services, all while tracking locations in real-time.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```bash
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
PORT=<port-number>
GEO_API_KEY=<api-key-for-geo-location-services>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<gemini-chatbot-api-key>
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with these variables.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints:

- **Register Business**: `POST /register-business`
  - Registers a new business with the provided details.
  
- **List Businesses**: `GET /businesses`
  - Fetches all the registered businesses.
  
- **Search Business**: `GET /search-business`
  - Search for businesses by name (case-insensitive).
  
- **Business Details**: `GET /business/:id`
  - Fetches details of a specific business by its ID.

## Geo-Location Tracking

The platform uses the device's GPS to enable businesses and customers to track location in real time. This is crucial for businesses that offer delivery services. The GPS system is integrated into the registration forms for both businesses and customers.

To enable geo-location tracking:

- Ensure the user's device allows location permissions.
- The business's location will be stored and used for tracking.
  
The platform leverages modern web APIs to handle location data and integrate it seamlessly with delivery services.
